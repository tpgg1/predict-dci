  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical and hemodynamic therapies, endovascular therapies often remain the last resort. Data from studies in large cohorts on the efficacy and safety of multiple immediate endovascular interventions are sparse. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of multiple repeat instant endovascular interventions in patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical, hemodynamic, and initial endovascular interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to therapies requiring {$\geq$}3 endovascular interventions during the course of treatment following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary end point was functional outcome at last follow-up (mRS {$\leq$}2). The secondary end point was angiographic response to endovascular therapies and the appearance of cerebral infarctions. RESULTS: During a 4-year period, 365 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated at our institution. Thirty-one (8.5\%) met the inclusion criteria. In 52 (14\%) patients, {$\leq$}2 endovascular interventions were performed as rescue therapy for refractory cerebral vasospasm. At last follow-up, a good outcome was noted in 18 (58\%) patients with {$\geq$}3 interventions compared with 31 (61\%) of those with {$\leq$}2 interventions (P = .82). The initial Hunt and Hess score of {$\leq$}2 was a significant independent predictor of good outcome (OR, 4.7; 95\% CI, 1.2-18.5; P = .03), whereas infarcts in eloquent brain areas were significantly associated with a poor outcome (mRS 3-6; OR, 13.5; 95\% CI, 2.3-81.2; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat instant endovascular intervention is an aggressive but feasible last resort treatment strategy with a favorable outcome in two-thirds of patients with refractory cerebral vasospasm and in whom endovascular treatment has already been initiated.},

  abstract = {As shown previously, the electrical function of the brain is critically dependent on cerebral blood flow in the sense that reduction beyond an ischemic threshold of approximately 15 ml/100 gm per minute (approximately 35\% of control) in the baboon leads to complete failure of the somatosensory evoked response. This study tests the hypothesis that electrical failure in ischemia may be directly associated with a massive release of intracellular K+ or with a critical degree of extracellular acidosis. By microelectrode techniques, measurements of blood flow, extracellular activity of K+ and H+ as well as evoked potential were made in the baboon neocortex. Reductions in blood flow were obtained by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and depression beyond the ischemic threshold of electrical function achieved by a reduction of systemic blood pressure which, in the ischemic zones, changed local cerebral blood flow proportionally. Abolition of evoked response could not be explained by depolarization by release of intracellular K+, nor was it critically dependent on cortical pH. However, the massive release of intracellular K+ was by itself critically dependent on cortical blood flow and occurred at 18 greater than 6 greater than 2 ml/100 gm per minute (median with 5\% confidence limits). Thus a dual threshold in ischemia for neuronal function is described, the threshold for release of K+ being clearly lower than the threshold for complete electrical failure. Further, the findings support the concept of an ischemic penumbra during which the neurons remain structurally intact but functionally inactive. That neurons can survive for some time in this state of lethargy is evidenced by the observations that an increase in rCBF, if sufficient, can restore evoked potential and normalize extracellular K+ activity as well as pH.},

Treatment options are limited and often ineffective despite many years of investigation and clinical trials. Modern advances in basic science have produced a much more complex, multifactorial framework in which delayed cerebral ischemia is better understood and novel treatments can be developed. Leveraging this knowledge to improve outcomes, however, depends on a holistic understanding of the disease process. We conducted a review of the literature to analyze the current state of investigation into delayed cerebral ischemia with emphasis on the major themes that have emerged over the past decades. Specifically, we discuss microcirculatory dysfunction, glymphatic impairment, inflammation, and neuroelectric disruption as pathological factors in addition to the canonical focus on cerebral vasospasm. This review intends to give clinicians and researchers a summary of the foundations of delayed cerebral ischemia pathophysiology while also underscoring the interactions and interdependencies between pathological factors. Through this overview, we also highlight the advances in translational studies and potential future therapeutic opportunities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Clazosentan has been investigated globally for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The authors evaluated its effects on vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality following aSAH in Japanese patients.                                         METHODS               Two similar double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies were conducted in 57 Japanese centers in patients with aSAH, after aneurysms were secured by endovascular coiling in one study and surgical clipping in the other. In each study, patients were randomly administered intravenous clazosentan (10 mg/hr) or placebo (1:1) starting within 48 hours of aSAH and for up to 15 days after aSAH. Stratified randomization based on World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade was performed using a centralized interactive web response system. Vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality within 6 weeks post-aSAH, including new cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficits as well as all-cause mortality, were the first primary endpoint in each study. The second primary endpoint was all-cause morbidity (new cerebral infarct or delayed ischemic neurological deficit from any causes) and all-cause mortality (all-cause morbidity/mortality) within 6 weeks post-aSAH. The incidence of individual components of the primary morbidity/mortality endpoints within 6 weeks and patient outcome at 12 weeks post-aSAH (including the modified Rankin Scale scores) were also evaluated. The above analyses were also performed in the population pooled from both studies.                                         RESULTS               In each study, 221 patients were randomized and 220 were included in the full analysis set of the primary analysis (109 in each clazosentan group, 111 in each placebo group). Clazosentan significantly reduced the incidence of vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality after aneurysm coiling (from 28.8\% to 13.6\%; relative risk reduction 53\%; 95\% CI 17\%\textendash 73\%) and after clipping (from 39.6\% to 16.2\%; relative risk reduction 59\%; 95\% CI 33\%\textendash 75\%). All-cause morbidity/mortality and poor outcome (dichotomized modified Rankin Scale scores) were significantly reduced by clazosentan after preplanned study pooling. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to those reported previously.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Clazosentan significantly reduced the combined incidence of vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality post-aSAH with no unexpected safety findings.

In this review, we detail the advances in the understanding of this area termed the ischaemic penumbra, from its discovery to the evolution of imaging techniques, and finally some of the treatments developed. Evolving from animal studies from the 70s and 80s and translated to clinical practice, the field of ischemic reperfusion therapy has largely been guided by an array of imaging techniques developed to positively identify the ischemic penumbra, including positron emission tomography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. More recently, numerous penumbral identification imaging studies have allowed for a better understanding of the progression of the ischaemic core at the expense of the penumbra, and identification of patients than can benefit from reperfusion therapies in the acute phase. Importantly, 40 years of critical imaging research on the ischaemic penumbra have allowed for considerable extension of the treatment time window and better patient selection for reperfusion therapy. The translation of the penumbra concept into routine clinical practice has shown that ``tissue is at least as important as time.''},

  abstract = {Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is one of the main prognosis factors for disability after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The lack of a consensual definition for DCI had limited investigation and care in human until 2010, when a multidisciplinary research expert group proposed to define DCI as the occurrence of cerebral infarction (identified on imaging or histology) associated with clinical deterioration. We performed a systematic review to assess whether preclinical models of SAH meet this definition, focusing on the combination of noninvasive imaging and neurological deficits. To this aim, we searched in PUBMED database and included all rodent SAH models that considered cerebral ischemia and/or neurological outcome and/or vasospasm. Seventy-eight publications were included. Eight different methods were performed to induce SAH, with blood injection in the               cisterna magna               being the most widely used (               n               = 39, 50\%). Vasospasm was the most investigated SAH-related complication (               n               = 52, 67\%) compared to cerebral ischemia (               n               = 30, 38\%), which was never investigated with imaging. Neurological deficits were also explored (               n               = 19, 24\%). This systematic review shows that no preclinical SAH model meets the 2010 clinical definition of DCI, highlighting the inconsistencies between preclinical and clinical standards. In order to enhance research and favor translation to humans, pertinent SAH animal models reproducing DCI are urgently needed.},

The 2023 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: A comprehensive search for literature published since the 2012 guideline, derived from research principally involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between March 2022 and June 2022. In addition, the guideline writing group reviewed documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association. Newer studies published between July 2022 and November 2022 that affected recommendation content, Class of Recommendation, or Level of Evidence were included if appropriate. Structure: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a significant global public health threat and a severely morbid and often deadly condition. The 2023 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to preventing, diagnosing, and managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' and their families' and caregivers' interests. Many recommendations from the previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.},

  abstract = {An awake-primate model has been developed which permits reversible middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion during physiological monitoring. This method eliminates the ischemia-modifying effects of anesthesia, and permits correlation of neurological function with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuropathology. The model was used to assess the brain's tolerance to focal cerebral ischemia. The MCA was occluded for 15 or 30 minutes, 2 to 3 hours, or permanently. Serial monitoring evaluated neurological function, local CBF (hydrogen clearance), and other physiological parameters (blood pressure, blood gases, and intracranial pressure). After 2 weeks, neuropathological evaluation identified infarcts and their relation to blood flow recording sites. Middle cerebral artery occlusion usually caused substantial decreases in local CBF. Variable reduction in flow correlated directly with the variable severity of deficit. Release of occlusion at up to 3 hours led to clinical improvement. Pathological examination showed microscopic foci of infarction after 15 to 30 minutes of ischemia, moderate to large infarcts after 2 to 3 hours of ischemia, and in most cases large infarcts after permanent MCA occlusion. Local CBF appeared to define thresholds for paralysis and infarction. When local flow dropped below about 23 cc/100 gm/min, reversible paralysis occurred. When local flow fell below 10 to 12 cc/100 gm/min for 2 to 3 hours or below 17 to 18 cc/100 gm/min during permanent occlusion, irreversible local damage was observed. These studies imply that some cases of acute hemiplegia, with blood flow in the paralysis range, might be improved by surgical revascularization. Studies of local CBF might help identify suitable cases for emergency revascularization.},

  abstract = {Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating stroke subtype with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. The poor clinical outcome can be attributed to the biphasic course of the disease: even if the patient survives the initial bleeding emergency, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) frequently follows within 2 weeks time and levies additional serious brain injury. Current therapeutic interventions do not specifically target the microvascular dysfunction underlying the ischemic event and as a consequence, provide only modest improvement in clinical outcome. SAH perturbs an extensive number of microvascular processes, including the ``automated'' control of cerebral perfusion, termed ``cerebral autoregulation.'' Recent evidence suggests that disrupted cerebral autoregulation is an important aspect of SAH-induced brain injury. This review presents the key clinical aspects of cerebral autoregulation and its disruption in SAH: it provides a mechanistic overview of cerebral autoregulation, describes current clinical methods for measuring autoregulation in SAH patients and reviews current and emerging therapeutic options for SAH patients. Recent advancements should fuel optimism that microvascular dysfunction and cerebral autoregulation can be rectified in SAH patients.},

  abstract = {The Kety-Schmidt technique can be regarded as the reference method for measurement of global average cerebral blood flow (average CBF) and global average cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (average CMRO2). However, in the practical application of the method, diffusion equilibrium for inert gas tracer between the brain and its venous blood is not reached. As a consequence, normal values for CBF and CMRO2 of 54 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and 3.5 ml 100 g-1 min-1 obtained with the Kety-Schmidt technique are an overestimation of the true values. Using the Kety-Schmidt technique we have performed 57 measurements of CBF and CMRO2 during EEG-verified wakeful rest in young normal adults. In order to estimate the equilibrium values for CBF and CMRO2, a simple computer-based simulation model was employed to quantitate the systematic overestimation caused by incomplete tracer equilibrium. When correcting the measured data, we find that the true average values for CBF and CMRO2 in the healthy young adult are approximately 46 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and approximately 3.0 ml 100 g-1 min-1. Previous studies have suggested that some of the variation in CMRO2 values could be ascribed to differences in cerebral venous anatomy. However in the present study, no correlation between CMRO2 and cerebral venous anatomy as imaged by magnetic resonance angiography could be established. Our data show that the interindividual variation of CMRO2 is 11\% (coefficient of variation).},

  abstract = {Background Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is a common complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Objective To report our institutional experience with intrathecal (IT) nicardipine for treatment of moderate to severe CV. Methods A retrospective study was performed for all patients treated with intrathecal nicardipine from October 2014-May 2017. The primary goal was to evaluate the safety of IT nicardipine to treat subarachnoid induced CV. Results. 48 patients with aSAH were treated with IT nicardipine for moderate or severe CV. The average age of patients was 49.6~years (range 14\textendash 77~years) with mean Hunt Hess of 3.2 and mean Fisher scores of 3.1. Patients were treated with different dosing regiments ranging from 2~mg q12 to 4~mg q8hr. The average total dose was 35.1~mg (range 6 to 112~mg). The average initiation of treatment was post bleed day 6 (range day 2\textendash 15) and length of treatment was 5.9~days (range 1\textendash 15~days.) 10/48 (20.8\%) patients underwent TBA with only 4/48 (8.3\%) treated after initiation of IT nicardipine. Three patients (6.3\%) developed meningitis/ventriculitis. Three (6.3\%) patients required ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 or 5) was achieved in 56.3\% of patients. Conclusions The use of intrathecal nicardipine should be considered a safe option in the treatment of moderate to severe cerebral vasospasm. The use of intrathecal nicardipine has resulted in a near discontinuation of balloon angioplasty in our institution. Randomized trials to identify the optimal dosing, timing, and length of treatment is warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Hypervolemia and hypertension therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm at many institutions. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about the preferred modality (hypervolemia, hypertension, or both), the degree of therapy (moderate or aggressive), and the risk or benefit of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, and aggressive hypertension in patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: Monitoring data and patient charts for 45 patients were retrospectively searched to identify periods of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, or aggressive hypertension. Measurements of central venous pressure, fluid input, urine output, arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure (PO2) in the brain tissue were extracted from periods ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours. For these periods, the change in brain tissue PO2 and the incidence of complications were analyzed. During the 55 periods of moderate hypertension, an increase in brain tissue PO2 was found in 50 cases (90\%), with complications occurring in three patients (8\%). During the 25 periods of hypervolemia, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during three intervals (12\%), with complications occurring in nine patients (53\%). During the 10 periods of aggressive hypervolemic hypertension, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during six of the intervals (60\%), with complications in five patients (50\%). CONCLUSIONS: When hypervolemia treatment is applied as in this study, it may be associated with increased risks. Note, however, that further studies are needed to determine the role of this therapeutic modality in the care of patients with cerebral vasospasm. In poor-grade patients, moderate hypertension (cerebral perfusion pressure 80-120 mm Hg) in a normovolemic, hemodiluted patient is an effective method of improving cerebral oxygenation and is associated with a lower complication rate compared with hypervolemia or aggressive hypertension therapy.},

  abstract = {Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) carries high mortality and disability rates, which are substantially driven by complications. Early brain injury and vasospasm can happen after SAH and are crucial events to prevent and treat to improve prognosis. In recent decades, immunological mechanisms have been implicated in SAH complications, with both innate and adaptive immunity involved in mechanisms of damage after SAH. The purpose of this review is to summarize the immunological profile of vasospasm, highlighting the potential implementation of biomarkers for its prediction and management. Overall, the kinetics of central nervous system (CNS) immune invasion and soluble factors' production critically differs between patients developing vasospasm compared to those not experiencing this complication. In particular, in people developing vasospasm, a neutrophil increase develops in the first minutes to days and pairs with a mild depletion of CD45+ lymphocytes. Cytokine production is boosted early on after SAH, and a steep increase in interleukin-6, metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) anticipates the development of vasospasm after SAH. We also highlight the role of microglia and the potential influence of genetic polymorphism in the development of vasospasm and SAH-related complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) still remains the leading cause of disability in patients that survive the initial ictus. It has been shown that computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging can detect hypoperfused brain areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a single acute CTP examination at time of neurologic deterioration is sufficient or if an additional baseline CTP increases diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of acute and baseline (within 24 hours after aneurysm treatment) CTP examinations of patients with neurologic deterioration because of vasospasm-related hypoperfusion. Patients without clinical deterioration during the vasospasm period served as control subjects. The following CTP parameters were analyzed for predefined brain regions: time to drain (TTD), mean transit time, time to peak, cerebral blood flow, and volume. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with and 23 without neurologic deterioration were included. Baseline CTP examination did not ameliorate diagnostic accuracy of the acute CTP examination in symptomatic patients. The same was true for interhemispheric comparison of perfusion parameters of the acute examination. The CTP parameter with the highest diagnostic yield was TTD of the symptomatic brain region (threshold value, 4.7 seconds; sensitivity, 97\%; specificity, 96\%). CONCLUSIONS: Acute CTP examination in case of suspected vasospasm-induced neurologic deterioration after aSAH has the highest diagnostic accuracy to detect misery perfusion. Additional baseline CTP is not needed. The most sensitive parameter to detect critically perfused brain areas is TTD.},
