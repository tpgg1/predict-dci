# Background


## Subarachnoidal Hemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) represents a critical medical emergency
triggered by the bursting of an aneurysm
within the brain's cerebral arteries (@fig-rupture).
This condition,
with an incidence of 10 per 100,000 individuals per year,
predominantly impacts those between 40 and 60 years old
[@connollyGuidelinesManagementAneurysmal2012].

![Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm resulting in increased intracranial pressure[@nchk].](figures/aneurysm-rupture.jpg){#fig-rupture}

When an aneurysm ruptures,
arterial blood is rapidly propelled into the subarachnoid space,
which is located around the brain
and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
This sudden influx of blood
under high pressure
leads to the condition known as SAH (@fig-sah).

![Subarachnoid hemorrhage. The escaping blood fills the space at the base of the skull and around the cerebral vessels[@nchk].](figures/sah.jpg){#fig-sah}

The main symptom is a sudden,
severe and extremely painful headache
also known as thunderclap headache.
The pain can be felt throughout the head
and can radiate to the neck and back.
In severe cases,
unconsciousness or a seizure may occur
only seconds later. 
In addition,
there may be variable neurological symptoms
such as speech disorders, paralysis, sensory disturbances and double vision.


## Cerebral Vasospasm
After aneurysm treatment,
our patients are subject to intensive monitoring 
in either the intensive care unit (ICU)
or the neurosurgical intermediate care unit (IMC)
for a length of 14 days.
During this two-week period,
patients are cautiously monitored
due to a possible insidious contraction of cerebral arteries,
caused by blood residues
within the subarachnoid space.
This pathological process,
referred to as cerebral vasospasm (CVS),
typically arises about 3 to 14 days after the bleeding (@fig-sah-onset).
It occurs in approximately one-third of SAH patients
[@thomasIncidenceCerebralVasospasm2020]
and carries the risk of further neurological complications.

![Estimated hazard function for the development of cerebral vasospasm.[@kellyConditionalVasospasmFreeSurvival2022]](figures/sah-onset.png){#fig-sah-onset}

![In a microsurgical operation, the ruptured aneurysm is closed with the help of a clip (left). A few days after surgical closure of the aneurysm, there may be a constriction of the large cerebral vessels, a so called cerebral vasospasm (right)[@nchk].](figures/vasospasm.jpg){#fig-vasospasm}

The contraction of cerebral vessels during CVS
affects the normal cerebral perfusion,
the process by which oxygenated blood is delivered to brain tissues (@fig-vasospasm).
A critical reduction in cerebral perfusion
can push brain tissues into a 'state of risk',
where they struggle to function due to insufficient oxygen supply.


## Cerebral Blood Flow
### Energy Budget
Despite the brain constituting merely 2% of total body weight,
it remarkably accounts for roughly 20% of the body's energy consumption
[@raichleAppraisingBrainEnergy2002].
This disproportionate energy consumption
is a reflection of the brain's complex and ceaseless activity,
for which a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose is crucial.
Normal cerebral blood flow,
which ensure this energy demand is met,
typically registers at approximately 50ml per 100g of brain tissue per minute.
[@ketyNITROUSOXIDEMETHOD1948, @madsenAverageBloodFlow1993]

### CBF Autoregulation
A stable Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) is essential
for the brain to function correctly.
To achieve this,
the brain uses a mechanism called cerebral autoregulation
[@lassenCerebralBloodFlow1959].
This mechanism keeps CBF steady,
even when there are short-term changes in systemic blood pressure.
In healthy individuals,
it works optimally
when the systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP)
is between 60 and 160 mmHg.
Cerebral autoregulation adjusts the resistance
in small cerebral arteries to manage CBF.
For example, when MAP goes down,
these arteries respond by dilating to decrease resistance
and keep CBF stable, as shown in @fig-autoregulation. 
A disrupted cerebral autoregulation is an important aspect
of SAH-induced brain injury[@lidingtonCerebralAutoregulationSubarachnoid2021, @armsteadCerebralBloodFlow2016].

![This figure illustrates the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in cerebral autoregulation. It defines a range where CBF stays stable despite MAP changes. If MAP drops below this range, perfusion reduces, but symptoms aren't visible until a critical threshold is crossed. This symptom-free zone is called the cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Below this capacity, hypoperfusion and ischemia occur, and above the upper limit, hyperperfusion and edema occur[@lidingtonCerebralAutoregulationSubarachnoid2021].](figures/autoregulation.jpg){#fig-autoregulation}

### The influence of vessel diameter on cerebral blood flow
- critical perfusion with reversible and irreversible thresholds
- hagen poiseuille equation
- refer to hp variables and treatment options
- refer to image CVS progression

A progressive reduction in vessel diameter 
as occuring in vasospasm after SAH
leads to a diminishing CBF
and therefore a stepwise reduction of brain function.
According to the vessel diameter reduction 
this process can vary 
from an asymptomatic CBF reduction
to reversible brain function distortion 
and in severe cases leads to irreversible brain demage 
via neuronal death (see @fig-thresholds).

## Delayed Cerebral Ischemia [^1]
[^1]: Include image-grid of cvs-progression,
normal and with deficite/ischemia.

Progressive CVS can transition from a 'state of risk' 
into Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI),
a severe neurological complication
that arises in 10-20% of SAH patients,
potentially leading to permanent brain damage or death
[@thomasIncidenceCerebralVasospasm2020].
DCI occurs when the diminished blood supply to the brain
reaches a critical level (ischemia),
leading to insufficient oxygen supply
to the brain tissue.
The treatment strategies for CVS
typically revolve around
improving cerebral blood flow,
utilizing medical, endovascular, or surgical interventions
[@connollyGuidelinesManagementAneurysmal2012].
Tragically,
despite all therapeutic efforts,
around 35% of SAH patients die within three months,
and over 50% of survivors experience an incomplete recovery
[@andersenCoreOutcomesSubarachnoid2019].

## Diagnostic Challenges
DCI is a complex condition 
that requires careful attention 
and continuous monitoring 
to diagnose and treat effectively.
It presents multiple challenges
for medical professionals.

__Delayed Onset__:
DCI typically occurs several days after a SAH,
meaning that patients may have recovered well
from the initial bleeding.
This creates an erroneous impression of safety
for patients and caretakers
by the time sudden, often insidious symptoms appear.

__Silent Vasospasm__:
In some cases,
DCI may not cause any apparent symptoms
and be hard to measure,
especially in comatose, intubated patients.
This is particularly challenging
because it might not be detected
until significant brain damage has already occurred.

__Fluctuating Course__:
The severity and location of the DCI can change rapidly,
which means continuous monitoring is necessary
for accurate diagnosis and management.

__Symptom Overlap__:
The symptoms of DCI,
such as confusion, weakness of a limb, and difficulty speaking,
are common to other neurological conditions
like delirium, epilepsy and critical illness polyneuropathy,
which can make accurate diagnosis difficult.


# Aim/Objective
In light of the intricate challenges 
surrounding the diagnosis and management of DCI following SAH,
the paramount objective of this project
is to develop and integrate 
a reliable early warning system.
This machine learning (ML) based system
aims at early identifying SAH patients
who are at an imminent risk 
of manifesting symptomatic DCI.

By realizing this aim,
we aspire to substantially reduce
the devastating neurological consequences of SAH patients
due to progressive or undiagnosed DCI,
ensuring that they receive timely attention and treatment.



# Methods
## Data Collection and Selection
The Inselspital Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
and Intermediate Care Unit (IMC)
see approximately 90 to 100 SAH patients per year.
Over the span of a decade, 
the Patient Data Management System (PDMS)
has gathered medical records 
for 800-1200 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhages,
about 300 of which involve DCI.
These figures form the basis of our data pool.
It should be noted that these cases,
while already known in clinical practice,
will necessitate a manual review
and detailed annotation for their identification.


## Annotation
Crucial to the data preparation phase
is the annotation of exact timing of DCI
and initial symptoms.
This will involve a careful and detailed review
of each patient's medical records
to accurately pinpoint these specific events.
The objective is to build a rich,
annotated dataset
that can be fed into the ML algorithm
for pattern detection and predictive modeling.


## Definition of a DCI Event [^4]
[^4]: Refer to cvs-progression figure 
and pinpoint timepoint of DCI event that needs to be predicted.

A DCI event in this study is defined by the following criteria: 

1. Aneurysmal SAH as shown by CT or MRI.
   
2. The emergence of, one of the below,
new neurological deficits such as:
- Aphasia
- Motor weakness
- Hypoesthesia
- New agitation or drowsiness (measured by the RASS score Â±2)
- Change in consciousness (measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale Â±2)
  
3. Vasospasms and/or
an new cerebral perfusion deficit 
in the affected brain area shown by:
- CT-Perfusion 
- MR-Perfusion
- Digital Subtraction Angiography (vasospasms)


## Role of the Data Science Student
A key player in the implementation of this project
will be a Master's student in data science.
His role will comprise
assisting in the annotation of patient data
and developing the ML methodology
to define and predict DCI onset.


## Development of Predictive Model [^2]  
[^2]:More input on that from Gunnar and the Student.

Building on the data science student's work,
the team will create a predictive model.
This model will be informed by
clinical and physiological variables
as well as imaging parameters
extracted from clinical records
to predict the onset of DCI. 


## Supervisory Expertise [^3]  
[^3]:Mention role of all authors/supervisors,
refer to CRediT statement/table
and cite exemplary works related to project.

Guiding this project will be 
the experience and expertise of the contributors, 
who bring valuable knowledge from SAH and ML research
[@hylandEarlyPredictionCirculatory2020].
Their guidance will be instrumental in
providing the project with 
a strong foundation and understanding
of the underlying pathology as well as
skills in data preparation, organization, and evaluation processes.



# Clinical Significance
At Inselspital,
patients with SAH
are cared for by an interdisciplinary,
highly specialized team
from the University Departments of Neurosurgery,
Neuroradiology and Intensive Care Medicine.
The optimal treatment of aneurysms
as well as the therapy of DCI
are among the major focus areas at our hospital. 

The creation of an early warning system for DCI
carries substantial clinical implications
for the following reasons:

__Improve patient outcomes__:
With an early detection mechanism,
there's a greater window for medical interventions,
thereby potentially reducing
the severe complications or fatalities associated with DCI.

__Improve management of comatose patients__:
For patients in a coma,
typical symptomatic DCI may not be noticeable.
An early detection system
could monitor physiological parameters
that might indicate the onset of DCI,
improving care and outcomes for these patients.

__Reduce monitoring burden__:
With an early detection system,
the burden of continuous
and intense monitoring of each patient for signs of DCI
can be reduced,
making it less likely
for warning signs to be missed
due to human error, fatigue, or oversight.

__Streamline resources:__ 
Continuous monitoring can be resource-intensive.
An early warning system
can help prioritize patients
who need the most attention,
ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated.

__Educate and Inform:__ 
A profound understanding of the indicators preceding DCI
could pave the way for discovering as-yet-unknown parameters
and their complex interactions
in the onset and progression of the condition.
This could significantly augment the existing body of knowledge,
providing invaluable insights for future research.



# Ethical Considerations
Given the sensitive nature
of the data involved in this project
and its potential implications for patient care,
it is essential to underscore
that this endeavor must be preceded
by a thorough ethical review.

Firstly,
confidentiality and privacy issues will be addressed,
considering that the data to be used for this study
come from real-world clinical cases.
All data will be anonymized,
and the project will adhere strictly
to data protection regulations.

Secondly,
in conducting the research and developing this system,
it's vital to take into account
any potential biases in the data used.
This includes a possible bias in the selection of data,
the risk of overfitting or underfitting the predictive models,
or the inclusion of irrelevant or misleading variables.
Any of these could potentially skew the model's results
and subsequently impact patient care.

Thirdly,
when implementing the ML-based early warning system,
there should be a clear understanding
of how the system's outputs will be utilized
and communicated within a clinical setting.
It is critical to ensure
that these tools do not override clinician judgment,
but rather, complement it,
as the nuances of patient care
can often extend beyond algorithmic interpretation.
Furthermore, the system should be designed and used in a way
that avoids creating undue anxiety
or false alarms among healthcare professionals and patients.

Lastly,
considering the serious consequences of DCI,
including severe neurological damage and death,
it's essential to ensure
that this project does not inadvertently elevate the risk to patients,
either by instilling an overreliance on the system
or by distracting from other critical elements of patient care.

In sum,
while the development of an early warning system for DCI
carries immense potential benefits,
it must be balanced against ethical considerations.
Prior to proceeding with this research,
a comprehensive ethical review will be conducted,
and the necessary approval obtained.



# Summary
This study proposes
an early warning system using ML
to predict symptomatic DCI in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients
managed in ICUs or IMCs.
CVS, a contraction of cerebral vessels post SAH,
risks severe neurological complications,
including permanent brain demage and death.
Because DCI symptoms are common to many neurological conditions,
appear days after SAH,
and vary in severity and location,
early detection is challenging but critical.
The system would leverage
a decade's worth of data
from the Patient Data Management System (PDMS) at Inselspital Bern,
with a data science student
helping annotate and develop a predictive model.
This tool promises timely intervention,
improved patient prognosis,
efficient patient management,
and reduced monitoring burdens.
