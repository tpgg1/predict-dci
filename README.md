# Early forecasting of delayed cerebral ischemia in the intensive care unit

Welcome to the fusion of neurosurgery
and data science!
We're a passionate team of neurosurgeons
and data scientists
working together on predicting
delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI)
in the intensive care unit.

Dive into our code, text, and findings,
and feel free to contribute.
Below are some explanations
as to the tools
we use to get you started.

## Our Project Plan: A Guiding Document

Our 
[project plan](https://github.com/murek-m/predict-dci/blob/master/project_plan.pdf)
serves as a practical guide and blueprint
for several key areas
of our early-stage project:

- __Ethics Application:__
  Guides the preparation of our ethics application.
- __Master's Thesis Proposal:__
  A starting point 
  for students crafting a master's thesis proposals.
- __Grant Applications:__
  Helps articulate research design and objectives
  for grant applications.
- __Machine Learning Models:__
  Outlines the types of models, algorithms,
  and techniques we plan to use,
  guiding the development
  and experimentation process.
- __Data Collection and Preprocessing:__
  Details the data sources, collection methods,
  and preprocessing steps,
  ensuring consistency across the project.
- __Presentations:__
  Serves as a foundation for presentations
  done within the scope of the project,
  whether for inhouse meetings,
  academic conferences or
  stakeholder reports.
- __Final Manuscript:__
  A reference for developing the final manuscript.

The project plan helps to keep us aligned
and focused on our shared goals.
Feel free to explore the
[source file](https://github.com/murek-m/predict-dci/blob/master/project_plan.pdf)
or [pdf-version](https://github.com/murek-m/predict-dci/blob/master/project_plan.qmd)
to see how we're using it
in various aspects of our project.

## Writing with Quarto Markdown (*.qmd)

Research should be accessible to various audiences,
engaging in its presentation,
easy to track through version control,
and reproducible to ensure integrity and reliability.
That's why we write using Quarto Markdown.

- __Simplicity:__
  Markdown's lightweight markup language
  lets us write in an easy-to-read,
  easy-to-write plain text format.
  [Learn more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
- __Beauty & Power:__
  Quarto takes things to the next level
  with beautiful, data-driven documents.
  We use the .qmd file format
  to blend the simplicity of Markdown
  with the power of Quarto.
  Check out Quarto's official
  [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
- __Flexibility:__
  From our Quarto Markdown base,
  we can generate PDF, Word, HTML, and more,
  ensuring our research is accessible
  in various forms.

## Semantic Linebreaks for Readability

We follow Semantic Linebreaks
to enhance readability
and maintainability in our source code.
Here's an example
to illustrate the concept:

**Without Semantic Linebreaks:**
```
My mama always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'
```


**With Semantic Linebreaks:**
```
My mama always said,
'Life was like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you're gonna get.'
```

By breaking the quote into lines,
the semantic linebreaks
make the source code more engaging
and easier to follow.
Importantly,
these linebreaks do not impact
the text rendering in the desired format,
such as PDF, Word, or HTML.
They simply make the text more manageable
within our collaboration tools.

You can see semantic linebreaks in action
right here at the source of this [README.md](https://github.com/murek-m/predict-dci/blob/master/README.md?plain=1) file!

## Bibtex

Citations matter,
and we've got them covered.
We use [Bibtex](https://www.bibtex.org) for our references,
and you can find all our citations
neatly organized under
[resources/references.bib](https://github.com/murek-m/predict-dci/blob/master/resources/references.bib). Feel free to explore.

## GitHub

You're here,
so you know we're on GitHub.
This is where all the magic happens.
We collaborate, share,
and evolve our project right here.
